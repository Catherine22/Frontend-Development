            There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and
            when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other,
            trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how
            she was ever to get out again. Suddenly she came upon a little
            three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it
            except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought was that it
            might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the
            locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it
            would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she
            came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it
            was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little
            golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!
